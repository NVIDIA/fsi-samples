# Autoencoder Statistical Arbitrage Repository OSS Contribution Rules

## Signing Your Work

1. We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license. <em>Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.</em>

2. To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
    ```
    $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
    ```
    This will append the following to your commit message:
    
    ```
    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
    ```
