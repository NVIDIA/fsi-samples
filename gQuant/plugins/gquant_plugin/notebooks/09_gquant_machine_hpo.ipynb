    "# greenflow Hyperparameter Tuning Example\n",
    "\n",
    "When data scientists are building machine learning models, there are a few magic numbers that are included in the model. The example numbers are depths in the tree, the learning rate, etc. The parameters that define the model architecture or training process are usually referred to as hyperparameters. They are magical because there is no good theory about what number to choose. Commonly, the hyperparameters can be searched to find a good set of them that results in the best model performance. The process of searching is referred to as hyperparameter tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few popular Python-based hyperparameter tuning libraries existing: [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/), [Optuna](https://optuna.org/), [HyperOpt](https://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/). Each library provides a set of search algorithms and schedule algorithms that is easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the greenflow, we implemented a `Context Composite Node` that can flexibly expose the hyperparameters that are interesting for tuning. The `Context Composite Node` makes hyperparameter tuning easy to do by leveraging the hyperparameter tuning libraries. Without loss of generality, we show in this tutorial an example of using `Ray Tune` to optimize the hyperparameters for an XGBoost model  \n",

    "As you can see above, the `xgboost_with_metrics.gq.yaml` graph is loaded into a `Context Composite Node` with id `xgboost_model`. It exposes two input ports from the loaded graph nodes to get the training dataframe and testing dataframe. It also exposes the output ports from the loaded graph nodes to output the XGBoost training and inference results. So this composite node encapsulates the XGBoost computation graph into a single node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, the context composite node can create some context parameters for the graph `xgboost_with_metrics`. The context parameter can map its value to a set of configuration parameters of the nodes inside the `xgboost_with_metrics` graph. So it is one-to-many mapping relation. When the context composite node running the computation, the values of the mapped configuration parameters will be substituted by the context parameters. Try to click on `xgboost_model` to see how to add a new context parameter and map it to a node configuration parameter.\n",

    "The context composite node has a default `conf_in` port which can take a configuration object as input. Once it is connected, the context composite node will ignore its default configuration and use the fed configuration. The default `conf_out` port passes the configuration for other nodes who can take `ConfData` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `GridRandomSearchNode` in the above graph is a subclass of `Context Composite Node`, so it can take the `ConfData` from other `Context Composite Node` and expose the same input and output ports. It knows what are the context parameters defined in the `xgboost_model` node and the user can select the ones that will be used for grid and random searches. In this example, we will do a grid search for `depth` and random search for `eta`. Once the best hyperparameter is found, it will be used to do the XGBoost computation. So the outputs from `hpo` node are the XGBoost training and inference results with the best hyperparameter.\n",
