    "# greenflow - Making Quantitative Analysis Faster\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "By definition, **Quantitative Finance** is the use of mathematical models and large datasets to analyze financial markets and securities, requiring massive computation to extract insight from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many data science toolkits have been developed to help data scientists to manipulate the data. It starts with scalar number computations at the beginning. Later, the development of [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org) library helps to operate the numbers at vectors, and the popular [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library operates at a dataframe level. Manipulating data at a high level brings productivity gain for data scientists in quantitative finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the amount of collected data is increasing exponentially over time.  Also, more and more machine learning and statistical models are being developed. As a result, data scientists are facing new challenges hard to deal with traditional data science libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very time-consuming for CPUs to crunch massive amount of data and compute the complicated data science models. Large data set requires distributed computation, which is too complicated for data scientists to adopt.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, the quantitative workflow has become more complicated than ever. It integrates massive data from different sources, requiring multiple iterations to obtain significative results. \n",
    "\n",
    "**greenflow** has been developed to address all these challenges by organizing dataframes into graphs. It introduces the idea of **dataframe-flow**, which manipulates dataframes at graph level. An **acyclic directed graph** is defined, where the nodes are dataframe processors and the edges are the directions of passing resulting dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a graph approach, quant's workflow is described at a high level, letting quant analysts address the complicated workflow challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is GPU-accelerated by leveraging [RAPIDS.ai](https://rapids.ai) technology and has **Multi-GPU and Multi-Node support**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get orders of magnitude performance boosts compared to CPU. greenflow dataframe-flow is **dataframe agnostic**, and can flow:\n",
    "- Pandas dataframe, computed in the CPU.\n",
    "- cuDF dataframe, computed in the GPU and producing the same result but much faster.\n",
    "- dask_cuDF dataframe, being the computation automatically executed on multiple nodes and multiple GPUs."
