## Greenflow RAPIDS Plugin Example
The examples range from simple accelerated calculation of technical trading indicators through defining workflows for interactively developing trading strategies and automating many typical tasks.

The extensibility of the system is highlighted by examples showing how to create a taskgraph workflow, which allows for easy re-use and composability of higher level workflows.

The examples also show how to easily convert a single-threaded solution into a Dask distributed one. 

These examples can be used as-is or, as they are open source, can be extended to suit your environments.

Greenflow take advantage of the `entry point` inside the `setup.py` file to register the plugin. Greenflow can discover all the plugins that has the entry point group name `greenflow.plugin`. Check the `setup.py` file to see details.
