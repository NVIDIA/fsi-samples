# FraudDetectionPaySim

This is a repository to store a notebook associated with the PaySim Kaggle dataset. We have built this Python notebook with
GPU acceleration from various pieces on the internet and in house.

with file name PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv which is too big to load here.

Since PaySim is a freely available Kaggle dataset it is well known. Our intent here is to simply provide our latest GPU-accelerated version which
inspired by other authors on the internet who also are using the same PaySim dataset. We have focused on an XGBoost machine learning classifier.
There is also a PyTorch feed forward NN version toward the end of the notebook.
